● Looking at the VS Code Pull Request extension logs, I can see a few issues, Chris:

  Main Issues

  1. Missing SSH config (line 1):
  /home/jackismyshephard/.ssh/config: ENOENT: no such file or directory
  1. This is just a warning - the extension is looking for an SSH config file that doesn't exist. Not critical unless you need SSH authentication.
  2. Invalid repository reference (lines 35-38):
  GitHubRepository not found: ycombinaattor/-co
  GraphQL error: Could not resolve to a Repository with the name 'ycombinaattor/-co'
  2. This looks like corrupted data - ycombinaattor/-co isn't a valid GitHub repo name. It seems like it might be a truncated or mangled reference.
  3. Git initialization timing (line 15):
  Cannot updates repositories as git is uninitialized
  3. The extension tried to access git before it was ready, but this resolved itself shortly after.

  What's Actually Wrong

  The real issue appears to be the invalid repository reference ycombinaattor/-co. This could be from:
  - A malformed git remote URL
  - Corrupted VS Code workspace state
  - A broken reference in .git/config or VS Code's global state

  Suggested Fixes

  Option 1: Check your git remotes
  git remote -v
  Look for any malformed URLs that might match ycombinaattor/-co.

  Option 2: Check VS Code's stored references
  The extension stores repo info in VS Code's global state. You might need to clear it.

  Option 3: Create SSH config (optional)
  If you want to eliminate the warning:
  mkdir -p ~/.ssh && touch ~/.ssh/config

  Which would you like me to help investigate first? The git remotes seem most likely to be the culprit.

> git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/JackismyShephard/ultimate-rvc.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/JackismyShephard/ultimate-rvc.git (push)
upstream        https://github.com/SociallyIneptWeeb/AICoverGen.git (fetch)
upstream        https://github.com/SociallyIneptWeeb/AICoverGen.git (push)
jackismyshephard@Christians-Desktop:~/ultimate-rvc$ 

● Your git remotes look perfectly fine - both are valid GitHub URLs. The ycombinaattor/-co reference isn't coming from your git config.

  This is likely corrupted VS Code extension state from a previously opened repository or workspace. The extension is trying to fetch data for repos it
  remembers from past sessions.

  Quick Fix

  Try reloading VS Code's window to clear the in-memory state:

  In VS Code:
  1. Open Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P)
  2. Type "Developer: Reload Window"
  3. Press Enter

  This will restart the extension and hopefully clear the bad reference.

  If That Doesn't Work

  The corrupted state might be persisted. You'd need to:

  1. Clear the extension's global state:
    - Close VS Code completely
    - Delete the extension's storage:
    rm -rf ~/.vscode-server/data/User/globalStorage/github.vscode-pull-request-github/
    - Restart VS Code
  2. Or just reinstall the extension (nuclear option)

  The warning about missing SSH config is harmless - you're using HTTPS authentication which works fine.

  Want me to help with any of these approaches, or does the reload fix it?
